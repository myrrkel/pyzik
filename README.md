Pyzik explores big music directories like:

                                    ./Rock/Artist1 - [1965] - Album1
                                    ./Rock/Artist1 - [1967] - Album2
                                    ./Rock/Artist2 - Album2 (1972)
                                    ...
                                    ./Blues/Artist3 - Album4
                                    ...

or

                                    ./Artist/1972 - Album1
